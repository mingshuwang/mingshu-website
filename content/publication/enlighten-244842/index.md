abstract: Polycentric urban development is gaining momentum in both scholarly research
  and real-life practice. This brings new demand for planning support systems to simulate
  and analyse the urban spatial structure in terms of polycentricity under various
  urban policy scenarios. With the help of emerging urban data, urban simulation techniques,
  and network science, this study proposes a workflow to simulate the urban spatial
  structure with spatial interaction as a part of the planning support system. Using
  Singapore as a case study, this study has explored the resulting urban spatial structure
  with four employment distribution strategies. The results suggest that planning
  practices impact urban spatial structure and its spatial interaction by redistributing
  urban morphological elements, such as employment in this study. Also, our results
  show that the physical urban spatial structure and spatial interaction are closely
  related. These results reinforce the role of urban planning practice to achieve
  a more sustainable and coherent urban built environment. Through this empirical
  evidence, our workflow exemplifies the potential of the planning support system
  to help urban planners and governments understand their urban policy regarding urban
  polycentricity.
