abstract: Urban areas serve as critical habitats for numerous plant species. Existing
  studies suggest that, due to human-mediated introductions, urban environments often
  harbor a greater variety of plant species compared to suburban areas, potentially
  becoming focal points for biodiversity. Consequently, investigating the driving
  forces and complex mechanisms by which urban environmental factors influence plant
  species distribution is essential for establishing the theoretical foundation for
  urban biodiversity conservation and future urban planning and management. Solar
  radiation, among these factors, is a critical determinant of plant growth, development,
  and reproduction. However, there is a notable lack of research on how this factor
  affects the distribution of urban plant species and influences species' richness
  and composition within plant communities. We present for the first time an analysis
  of how solar radiation drives the spatial distribution of plant species within the
  built-up areas of Nanchang City, China. Based on three years of monitoring and survey
  data from experimental sites, this study employs three evaluation models-Species
  Richness Index (R), Simpson's Diversity Index (D), and Shannon-Wiener Index (H)-to
  analyze and validate the survey results. Additionally, MATLAB and ArcGIS Pro software
  are utilized for the numerical simulation and visualization of spatial data. Our
  study shows that areas with low solar radiation exhibit higher plant species richness,
  while plots with high plant diversity are primarily concentrated in regions with
  strong solar radiation. Moreover, the Diversity Index D proves to be more sensitive
  than the Shannon-Wiener Index (H) in evaluating the spatial distribution of plant
  species, making it a more suitable metric for studying urban plant diversity in
  our study area. Among the 18 plant species analyzed, Mulberry and Dandelion are
  predominantly dispersed by birds and wind, showing no significant correlation with
  solar radiation. This finding indicates that the spatial distribution of urban plant
  species is influenced by multiple interacting factors beyond solar radiation, highlighting
  the critical need for long-term observation, monitoring, and analysis. This study
  also suggests that shaded urban areas may serve as hubs of high species richness,
  while regions with relatively strong solar radiation can sustain greater plant diversity.
  These findings underscore the practical significance of this research, offering
  essential insights to guide urban planning and management strategies. Additionally,
  this study offers valuable insights for the future predictions of plant species
  distribution and potential areas of high plant diversity in various urban settings
  by integrating computational models, building data, Digital Elevation Models (DEMs),
  and land cover data.
