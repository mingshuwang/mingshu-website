abstract: This study explores the empirical relationship between city-level urban
  forms and CO2 emissions in 104 Chinese prefectural-level cities. Although the analytical
  focus is on polycentric urban forms, the analysis has also accounted for population
  size and land use compactness. CO2 emissions data are aggregated from the Fossil
  Fuel Data Assimilation System (FFDASv2) data portal. The analysis identifies substantial
  economies of scale in CO2 with respect to total population. Further, despite a substantial
  wealth effect on CO2 emissions, cities with more centralized and compact urban forms
  are associated with lesser emissions, ceteris paribus. Whereas existing analyses
  of CO2 emissions in Chinese cities have often been limited to a handful of provincial
  capitals, the analysis covers a larger sample of cities. The paper concludes with
  spatial planning policy implications.
