abstract: Shrinking cities in China have garnered growing academic attention. However,
  most studies analyze these cities independently, overlooking their roles within
  broader urban networks. This study utilizes intercity migration and investment flow
  data to explore the roles of shrinking cities in China's urban network, focusing
  on flow patterns, network connectivity, and spatial interdependencies. The results
  show that migration outflows from shrinking cities are concentrated in provincial
  capitals, whereas investment flows predominantly target national economic centers
  such as Beijing and Shanghai. Shrinking cities demonstrate higher connectivity in
  migration networks than in investment networks, often functioning as peripheral
  nodes with constrained influence. Distinct spatial patterns between migration and
  investment flows reveal significant regional disparities, highlighting uneven economic
  interdependencies across China's regions. We propose a comprehensive framework integrating
  flow pattern analysis, network metrics, and spatial association modeling to assess
  shrinking cities' roles in regional population and capital redistribution. The findings
  offer critical insights into the network roles of shrinking cities, supporting the
  formulation of coordinated development strategies across China's regions.
