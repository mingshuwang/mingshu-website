abstract: Traffic flow data has been used in various disciplines, including geography,
  transportation, urban planning, and public health. However, existing datasets often
  have limitations such as low spatiotemporal resolution and inconsistent quality
  due to data collection methods and the need for an adequate data cleaning process.
  This paper introduces a long-term traffic flow dataset at an intra-city scale with
  high spatio-temporal granularity. The dataset covers the Glasgow City Council area
  for four consecutive years spanning the COVID-19 pandemic, from October 2019 to
  September 2023, providing comprehensive temporal and spatial coverage. Such detailed
  information facilitates diverse applications, including traffic dynamic analysis,
  traffic management, infrastructure planning, and urban environment improvement.
  Also, it provides a valuable dataset to understand traffic flow change during a
  once-in-a-lifetime pandemic event.
