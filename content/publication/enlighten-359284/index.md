abstract: This research compares the performance of deep learning models and large
  language models in a time  series traffic flow prediction. The evaluation results
  reveal distinct model performance differences  based on dataset selection and input
  length. Deep learning models show similar performance between  different datasets,
  while large language models exhibit significant improvements when trained on post-COVID-19
  data. Regarding input length, longer sequences generally enhance predictions. Large  language
  models consistently reduce error metrics as input length increases, while deep learning
  models  maintain a relatively stable trend. These findings highlight the superior
  capacity of large language  models to process and utilise long-term dependencies
  in time series prediction.
