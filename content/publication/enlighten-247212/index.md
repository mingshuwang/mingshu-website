abstract: Recent developments for acquiring and distributing remotely-sensed data
  have greatly increased data availability to the user community. The past two decades
  have witnessed an explosion in data acquisition by a variety of ground, airborne
  and orbital sensors. The popularization of Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) and the
  development of reduced cost orbital platforms should guarantee that even higher
  data volumes will be available to future analysts. The past decades also saw the
  opening of image data archives (e.g., Landsat, CBERS, Sentinel), making access to
  a rich database of moderate resolution satellite images a reality across the globe.
  This increased volume and variety of remotely-sensed data increases the demand for
  methods and procedures for data handling and information extraction. This chapter
  describes recent efforts to expand the analyst's data processing toolset and includes
  the theory and strategies used in manipulating remotely-sensed data by digital systems.
  The text focuses on presenting algorithms and techniques for image processing and
  analysis and emphasizes recent developments not covered by previous editions of
  the ASPRS Manual of Remote Sensing. Although the main topics covered by the chapter
  involve the direct processing of images, the text also covers concepts involved
  in processing remote sensing data that may not have been collected or stored as
  images, such as spectral curves acquired by spectroradiometers. Several sections
  of this chapter match this description, including Spectral Vegetation Indices and
  Spectral Mixture Analysis. Image processing includes not only the analysis of images,
  but also the necessary steps involved in preparing images for analysis, such as
  geometric correction, atmospheric correction and several techniques associated with
  image enhancement. Spectral indices resulting from the combination of multiple spectral
  bands are presented, with emphasis on the description of vegetated targets. A detailed
  treatment is given to the mixture problem resulting from the contribution of multiple
  materials within the instantaneous field of view (IFOV) of a given sensor. Because
  multiple applications can benefit from the increased explanation power provided
  by a large number of spectral bands, hyperspectral data processing is also presented
  and discussed. Further, the chapter addresses the benefits and challenges involved
  in combining datasets acquired by different systems (Data Fusion). Image classification
  addresses multiple strategies involved in assigning classes to images (e.g., Support
  Vector Machine, and Decision Trees); and includes advances in Object-Based Image
  Analysis (OBIA), particularly those related to image segmentation in preparation
  for classification. Given the increasing length of remotely-sensed data time series,
  particular attention is given to preparing sequences of images and data, including
  multiple techniques for smoothing, spike removal and the retrieval of metrics associated
  with temporal variations of targets. The chapter also brings multiple examples of
  use of products derived from processing remotely-sensed data as input to a variety
  of workflows, including modeling and analysis efforts. Finally, very current topics
  involving recent advances in image acquisition and availability, are presented for
  generating 3D surfaces from multiple images using Structure from Motion (SfM); processing
  of very large datasets (Big Data); and processing of images in the cloud are presented.
