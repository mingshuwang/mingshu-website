abstract: Developing countries tend to exhibit evident urban-rural income divergence
  as urban areas rapidly expand into adjoining land. However, Western-centric urban
  theories and studies of spatial inequality have not paid sufficient attention to
  the connection between income divergence and urban expansion. This paper employed
  a panel quantile regression model to investigate this relationship in 220 prefecture-level
  Chinese cities in 2006-2014. To identify potential spatiotemporal effects, we conducted
  additional robustness checks using the spatial Durbin model and geographical and
  temporal weighted regression. The results show that a 1 % expansion of urban land
  decreases the urban-rural income gap by 0.005 % to 0.011 %. This narrowing effect
  is particularly prominent in the eastern and central regions and in areas that are
  less urbanized overall. It also varies within regions that have a more pronounced
  difference between the lowest and highest quantiles in northeastern China and cities
  with urbanization rates of &gt;50 %. Finally, we find evidence for an inverted U-shaped
  relationship between urban expansion and the urban-rural income gap. Our results
  entail suggestions for improved urban-rural development policies aimed toward greater
  integration and efficiency in urban expansion.
