abstract: The emergence and development of the Internet of Things (IoT) has attracted
  growing attention to low-cost location systems when facing the dramatically increased
  number of public infrastructure assets in smart cities. Various radio frequency
  identification (RFID)-based locating systems have been developed. However, most
  of them are impractical for infrastructure asset inspection and management on a
  large scale due to their high cost, inefficient deployment, and complex environments
  such as emergencies or high-rise buildings. In this paper, we proposed a novel locating
  system by combing the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) with RFID, in which
  a target tag was located with one RFID reader and one GNSS receiver with sufficient
  accuracy for infrastructure asset management. To overcome the cost challenge, one
  mobile RFID reader-mounted GNSS receiver is used to simulate multiple location known
  reference tags. A vast number of reference tags are necessary for current RFID-based
  locating systems, which means higher cost. To achieve fine-grained location accuracy,
  we utilize a distance-based power law weight algorithm to estimate the exact coordinates.
  Our experiment demonstrates the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed scheme
  with sufficient accuracy, low cost and easy deployment on a large scale. The proposed
  scheme has potential applications for location-based services in smart cities.
