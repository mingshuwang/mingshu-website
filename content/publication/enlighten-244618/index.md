abstract: The considerable gap between urban and rural areas in China has been one
  of those social problems during the urbanization process. Since the early 2000s,
  an increasing number of theoretical and empirical studies have discussed the association
  between urbanization and urban-rural income gap (URIG) in China. However, a very
  limited consensus has been reached so far, which makes it challenging to support
  formulating well-informed policies. To identify factors contributing to different
  conclusions of the effects of urbanization on URIG in China, we conducted a systematic
  literature review of 29 empirical studies and stepwise meta-regression analysis
  from 94 direct effect-size estimates. Our findings reveal that while urbanization
  is associated with larger URIG when URIG is measured via urban-rural income/consumption,
  urbanization is associated with smaller URIG when URIG is measured with inequality
  index (e.g., Theil index and/or Gini coefficient). Additionally, financial development
  is correlated with larger URIG. By contrast, human capital level, agricultural support
  policy, and farmland scale contribute to narrowing URIG. Finally, we did not find
  a significant publication bias from the primary studies. This work suggests that
  it is worth to conduct more in-depth analysis to examine the heterogeneous effects
  of different indicators of URIG and their associations with other potential driving
  factors. Future work is suggested to investigate the effects of financial development
  level, human capital level, agricultural support policy, farmland scale, and urban
  land scale on the relationship between urbanization and URIG. In the urbanization
  process, policymakers need to pay attention to the practice of remedying income-based
  urban-rural inequality.
