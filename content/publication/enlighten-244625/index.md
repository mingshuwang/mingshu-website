abstract: In many big cities, the bike-sharing system (BSS) and taxi play critical
  roles in transportation services. They both offer on-demand transportation options
  and allow flexible riding scheduling and routing. Previous literature has compared
  BSS and taxi to other transport modes, such as public transit and private automobile,
  but little is known about the spatiotemporal factors that influence travel choices
  between these two alternatives. Understanding travel patterns of BSS and taxi is
  critical in traffic demand analysis and sustainable transportation planning. Also,
  an in-depth examination of the patterns of travel behaviors, especially when one
  would choose BSS over a taxi, will provide valuable insights on human mobility and
  active living research. In this study, we investigated the spatiotemporal patterns
  of BSS and taxi trips in Chicago from 2014 to 2016. To model travel choices between
  BSS and taxi, we applied machine learning techniques to simulate the means of transport
  based on environmental and temporal factors. Results show seasonal trip variations
  of the BSS and a declining trend of taxi trips. BSS speed is relatively stable while
  taxi speed varies primarily because of time and locations. Based on the random forest
  model, which has demonstrated the best fit with high processing speed, travel distance
  and the number of parks and recreational facilities seem to be critical spatial
  predicting factors of the travel choice. Given any time and location, the model
  can recommend the travel choices between BSS and taxis for users. This study shows
  the significance of machine learning techniques in urban mobility research. Results
  of the study may potentially support people's transportation decision-making and
  facilitate sustainable transportation planning.
