abstract: 'Industrial regions and relevant infrastructures are known to contribute
  to air pollutant emissions; thus, a detailed investigation of the air pollutant
  concentrations of a region based on specific land uses, with spatial reasoning,
  can support smart regional planning. However, the current knowledge about the spatial
  patterns that indicate the relationship between the anthropological or environmental
  features and the air pollutant concentrations in industrial regions is limited.
  Thus, in this study, we aimed to identify the factors that affect air-pollutant
  concentrations due to local spatial impacts in industrial regions across Australia.
  Considering the large spatial scale, the impact of a global factor can be overwhelmed
  by another factor due to local spatial impacts, and the phenomenon is a kind of
  spatial disparity. We developed a novel set of methods, including a point-of-interests-based
  spatial identification method and geographically weighted regression (with standardised
  coefficients), to: (i) identify the industrial regions in the study area, (ii) collect
  the remote sensing factors, and (iii) identify the factors that affect the spatial
  disparity of air-pollutant concentrations in industrial regions. The results indicated
  a significant spatial disparity in the air pollutant concentrations in the industrial
  region, at a continental scale. Anthropogenic factors significantly affected the
  spatial patterns of air pollutant concentrations in the industrial regions that
  were remote to cities, whereas meteorological and topographical factors had significant
  impacts on the air pollutant distributions in urban industrial regions. Furthermore,
  within the nationwide industrial lands, drives of the relatively high concentrations
  of ozone and sulphur dioxide, the drivers of the air pollutant concentrations were
  environmental factors; high concentrations of nitrogen dioxide were more associated
  with the topographical features of the region. The methods proposed in this study
  can serve as a reliable framework for analysing the air quality of industrial regions
  and can also, supplement future studies on emissions reduction in industrial parks.'
