abstract: Despite the development of various heuristic and machine learning models,
  social media user occupation predication remains challenging due to limited high-quality
  ground truth data and difficulties in effectively integrating multiple data sources
  in different modalities, which can be complementary and contribute to informing
  the profession or job role of an individual. In response, this study introduces
  a novel semi-supervised multimodal learning method for Twitter user occupation prediction
  with a limited number of training samples. Specifically, an unsupervised learning
  model is first designed to extract textual and visual embeddings from individual
  tweet messages (textual) and Google Street View images (visual), with the latter
  capturing the geographical and environmental context surrounding individuals' residential
  and workplace areas. Next, these high-dimensional multimodal features are fed into
  a multilayer transfer learning model for individual occupation classification. The
  proposed occupation prediction method achieves high evaluation scores for identifying
  Office workers, Students, and Others or Jobless people, with the F1 score for identifying
  Office workers surpassing the best previously reported scores for occupation classification
  using social media data.
