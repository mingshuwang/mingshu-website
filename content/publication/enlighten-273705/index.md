abstract: Urban challenges are increasingly framed in the context of broader objectives
  of socio-economic development and macro-regional evolutions. Cities and the myriad
  networks in which they are embedded have thus been placed at the center of regional
  integration agendas. This paper benchmarks contemporary regional integration levels
  in the Horn of Africa by examining its cities' connectivities in transport networks.
  To this end, we specify a composite network consisting of air/train/road connectivity
  and analyze cities' eigenvector and betweenness centralities within these networks.
  We find that the importance of national spaces for inter-city connectivity is much
  more evident in the Horn of Africa than in other parts of the world, which is also
  visible in the peripheralization of cities in borderlands. We argue that the region's
  connectivity needs to be understood from a multiscalar and multimodal perspective
  and provide a baseline against which the impact of future interventions aimed at
  enhancing city connectivity/regional integration can be examined.
