abstract: Since cannabis (marijuana) has been listed by the U.S. federal government
  as a Schedule I substance under the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, legalization
  of cannabis has been a hot topic for decades. In this featured graphic, a total
  number of 296,192 self-reported cannabis records from the contiguous United States
  were collected by crowdsourcing. With a national average cannabis price of 284 USD/oz.,
  states with the highest price of cannabis are where cannabis possession/selling
  is illegal and the sample size is small; states with the lowest price of cannabis
  where cannabis possession/selling is legal.
