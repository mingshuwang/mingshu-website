abstract: Unlike the data from traditional sources, there have not been standard ways
  to validate the quality and reliability of information derived from big data. This
  article argues that the theory of urban formation can be used to do the validation.
  In addition, the information derived from big data can be used to verify and even
  extend existing theories or hypotheses of urban formation. It proposes a general
  framework regarding how the theory of urban formation can be employed to validate
  information derived from smart card data and how the validated information can supplement
  other data to reveal spatial patterns of economic agglomeration or human settlements.
  Through a case study of Beijing, it demonstrates the usefulness of the framework.
  Additionally, it utilizes smart card data to delineate characteristics of subcenters
  defined by bus commuters of Beijing.
