abstract: Urban traffic analysis has played an important role in urban development,
  providing insights for urban planning, traffic management, and resource allocation.
  Meanwhile, the global pandemic of COVID-19 has significantly changed people's travel
  behaviour in urban areas. This research uses the spatial Durbin model to understand
  the relationship between traffic flows, urban infrastructure, and socio-demographic
  indicators before, during, and after pandemic periods. We include factors such as
  road characteristics, socio-demographics, surrounding built environments (land use
  and nearby points of interest), and the emerging urban big data source of Google
  Street View images to understand their influences on time series traffic flows.
  Taking the city of Glasgow as the case study, we have found that areas with more
  young and white dwellers are associated with more traffic flows, while natural green
  spaces are associated with fewer traffic flows. Major roads between cities and towns
  also show heavier traffic flows. Besides, the application of Google Street View
  images in this research has revealed the heterogeneous effects of green space on
  urban traffic flows, as the magnitudes of their effects vary by distance. We also
  detect that the spatial dependence between adjacent neighbourhoods among the traffic
  flows and associated urban parameters is variable during the four COVID-19 periods.
  With the influence of COVID-19, there has been a significant decrease in long-distance
  travel. The noticeable change in travel behaviour presents a valuable opportunity
  to encourage active travel in the near future.
