abstract: The exact location of objects, such as infrastructure, is crucial to the
  systematic understanding of the built environment. The emergence and development
  of the Internet of Things (IoT) have attracted growing attention to the low-cost
  location scheme, which can respond to a dramatic increasing amount of public infrastructure
  in smart cities. Various Radio Frequency IDentification (RFID)-based locating systems
  and noise mitigation methods have been developed. However, most of them are impractical
  for built environments in large areas due to their high cost, computational complexity,
  and low noise detection capability. In this paper, we proposed a novel noise mitigation
  solution integrating the low-cost localization scheme with one mobile RFID reader.
  We designed a filter algorithm to remove the influence of abnormal data. Inspired
  the sampling concept, a more carefully parameters calibration was carried out for
  noise data sampling to improve the accuracy and reduce the computational complexity.
  To achieve robust noise detection results, we employed the powerful noise detection
  capability of the random sample consensus (RANSAC) algorithm. Our experiments demonstrate
  the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed method for the localization and
  noise mitigation in a large area. The proposed scheme has potential applications
  for location-based services in smart cities.
