abstract: On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization announced the novel coronavirus
  disease (COVID-19) as a pandemic. Despite an increasing number of international
  attempts using maps to present and communicate COVID-19-related information in different
  organizations, most map products have only used the presentation function of maps.
  Against this backdrop, we offer an automatically daily-updated, color-blind-friendly,
  Tableau-based interactive dashboard to demonstrate where and how different countries
  are fighting against COVID-19. The dashboard allows users to specify countries they
  want to compare and aggregate relevant data on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis.
