abstract: Master plans are pivotal in strategising urban development, dictating land
  use, building height, and development intensity. These plans influence the spatial
  arrangement of urban infrastructure and activities, shaping the morphological and
  dynamic urban spatial structure. This study evaluates Singapore's master plan's
  effect on urban spatial structure, utilising data extracted from the master plan
  to project future land use and spatial interaction scenarios. By simulating the
  changing commercial floor space in different urban centres and its impact on commuting
  patterns, we evaluate the master plan's impact on urban spatial structure and promoting
  polycentric urban development. Singapore's master plan, with a clear vision towards
  polycentricity through the 'Local hubs and global gateways' strategy, is examined
  for its impact on urban spatial structure. The study uses urban mobility data and
  spatial network analysis to reveal how the master plan aims to decentralise development
  from the Central Business District (CBD) and distribute economic activities across
  various regions. Our findings indicate that regional centres and local hubs are
  becoming more autonomous while the CBD remains dominant. The results also highlight
  the importance of integrating morphological and functional polycentricity measurements
  and socioeconomic indicators to comprehensively evaluate urban development strategies.
  This study contributes to understanding urban spatial structure and offers practical
  insights for future urban planning.
