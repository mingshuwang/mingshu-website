abstract: In resonance with the popularity of user-generated contents (UGC) and the
  volunteered geographic information (VGI), this study crowdsourced 77,098 hotel reviews
  of 220 hotels provided by U.S. reviewers in the city of San Francisco, 2002 to 2015.
  In this exploratory analysis, we have revealed that there is spatial dependence
  of customer satisfaction at different locations (of hotels), which violates the
  assumption that ordinary least-square (OLS) is the best linear unbiased estimator
  (BLUE); therefore, spatial model might be required for analysing any antecedents
  and consequences of such phenomena. These results have implications in marketing
  and management strategies.
