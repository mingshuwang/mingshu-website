abstract: Although the Academy Award for Best International Feature Film is often promoted as a celebration of world cinema, its record tells a different story. By mapping every nomination and win since the category adopted a competitive format in 1956, this study exposes a sharp geographic imbalance. A proportional-symbol cartogram shows Europe ballooning to dominate the visual field, while much of the Global South, especially Africa, nearly disappears. Four of the five most-honoured countries are European, together with Japan accounting for more than half of all victories. This pattern is interpreted as a geographic expression of cultural hegemony, explained partly by the theory of ‘cultural proximity’, where Academy voters may gravitate towards narratives reflecting familiar cultural values. The cartogram thus visualizes more than just awards; it depicts a durable geography of cultural influence. }
