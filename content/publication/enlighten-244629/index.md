abstract: The existing literature suggests that travel distance is a crucial factor
  that determines tourism demand and tourist behavior. However, there are limited
  attempts to understand how tourists' travel distance shapes their experiences, and
  more specifically, their satisfaction in a destination. This paper aims to shed
  light on the distance-satisfaction relationship by analyzing a data set of online
  hotel reviews at four large US cities in a one-year period. The results show an
  inverted U-shaped relationship between travel distance and service satisfaction.
  Inflection points of the quadratic relationship across different cities are also
  identified. The implications of these findings contribute to literature on tourism
  geography and allow tourism marketers to develop more effective differential marketing
  strategies.
