abstract: Mangroves are critical in the ecological, economic and social development
  of coastal rural and urban communities. However, they are under threat by climate
  change and anthropogenic activities. The Sunda Banda Seascape (SBS), Indonesia,
  is among the world's richest regions of mangrove biomass and biodiversity. To inform
  current and future management strategies, it is critical to provide estimates of
  how mangroves will respond to climate change in this region. Therefore, this paper
  utilized spatial analysis with model-based climatic indicators (temperature and
  precipitation) and mangrove distribution maps to estimate a benchmark for the mangrove
  biomass of the SBS in six scenarios, namely the Last Inter-glacial Period, the current
  scenario (1950-2000) and all four projected Representative Concentration Pathways
  in 2070 due to climate change. Despite mangroves gaining more biomass with climate
  change (the increase in CO2 concentration), this paper highlighted the great proportion
  of below-ground biomass in mangrove forests. It also showed that the changes in
  spatial distribution of mangrove biomass became more variable in the context of
  climate change. As mangroves have been proposed as an essential component of climate
  change strategies, this study can serve as a baseline for future studies and resource
  management strategies.
