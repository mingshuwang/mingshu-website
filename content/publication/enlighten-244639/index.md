abstract: Conventional ways of trip planning using online reviews from multiple sources
  are often cumbersome and uncustomizable. The advance in information and communication
  technology (ICT) and the surge in user-generated contents (UGC) provide great opportunities
  to facilitate trip planning. This paper proposes a travel-planning tool by crowdsourcing
  multiple UGCs to provide customized information for tourists. We harvested hotel
  customer reviews from TripAdvisor, photo information from Flickr, and travel costs
  between destinations from Uber. First, we used geospatial data mining approaches
  to extract tourism attractions information from Flickr; identified multi-facet characteristics
  of hotels with natural language processing (NLP); and provided travel route recommendations
  with graph analysis. Second, we developed a web-based interface to let users communicate
  with the system interactively, which provides integrated recommendations including
  attractions, hotels, and visit route sequences. Two cities in the United States
  (i.e. Atlanta and Chicago) were used as cases to illustrate our approaches. The
  proposed travel planning tool is not only beneficial to support customized travel
  decision-making, but also supportive for hotel managers with strategic management
  implications.
