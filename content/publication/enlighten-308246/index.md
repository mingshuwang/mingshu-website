abstract: Glasgow, Scotland, United Kingdom, has long-term issues with inequalities
  in health and food security, as well as large areas of vacant and derelict land.
  Urban agriculture projects can increase access to fresh food, improve mental health
  and nutrition, and empower and bring communities together. We investigated the distribution
  of urban agriculture in Glasgow and found that the current configuration of urban
  agriculture projects is mostly located centrally in the city, covering 36 % of the
  total population (approximately 635,000) within 10-minute walking distance. We also
  found a positive correlation (r = 0.13, p = 0.0003) between the walking travel time
  to the nearest urban agriculture project and the food desert status. To increase
  urban agriculture access across the city, we used the Maximal Covering Location
  Problem (MCLP) model to optimally situate new urban agriculture projects on vacant
  and derelict land to maximize the covered population. We identified that a minimum
  of 15 new urban agriculture projects could increase the population coverage to 49
  % and equalize the access disparity to a statistically non-significant level. This
  research shows that converting vacant and derelict land in Glasgow into urban agriculture
  projects could both help with the city's problem of vacant and derelict land and
  bring many potential benefits to local communities.
