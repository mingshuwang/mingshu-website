abstract: In the U.S., various anti-sprawl land use regulations have been implemented
  for over two decades. Previous studies primarily investigate the impacts of local
  land use regulations or neighborhood-level built environment attributes on travel
  behaviors within a narrow time frame. Through a different lens, this paper examines
  how various local land use regulations and transit investment, both measured at
  the aggregated metropolitan level, have affected people's long-term travel behaviors
  over a 15-year period, and how these impacts differ between younger and older age
  groups. This study combines a set of land use regulation indices measured at the
  metropolitan level in 2003 with 15 years of travel data (2005-2019) from a pooled
  representative sample of over 8 million workers in the 50 largest U.S. metropolitan
  areas. Results show several local anti-sprawl land use regulations (e.g., growth
  containment, adequate public facilities, and moratoria), when combined at the metropolitan
  level, effectively reduced driving notwithstanding their marginal effects. Government
  investment in public transit also significantly increased commuters' likelihood
  of using public transit and, carpooling, as well as increased carpool group size.
  Moreover, the commuting mode choices of younger workers are more responsive to transit
  improvements and land use regulations. Urban planners should commit to regional
  cooperative planning to promote effective land use regulations at the metropolitan
  level. Regional collaborative entities, such as metropolitan planning organizations
  should play a larger role in coordinating local land use planning and regulations.
  To reduce automobile dependency, planners should commit to improving public transit
  through enhanced financial assistance, harnessing land use regulations in a more
  targeted way, and accommodating the needs of different age cohorts.
