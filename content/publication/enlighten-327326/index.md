abstract: "Urban morphology profoundly influences city planning and experiences significant\
  \ transformations as cities evolve. This paper investigates paradigm shifts in block-level\
  \ planning through a case study of Singapore, a city celebrated for its precision\
  \ in urban planning and swift transformation. Integrating urban morphology theories\
  \ with empirical data, we explore Singapore's block-level urban form across various\
  \ stages of development. Utilising a Spacematrix approach alongside a clustering\
  \ analysis of urban blocks, we categorise Singapore's towns into four distinct clusters:\
  \ Suburban, Balanced Mix, Dense Urban, and Vertical Growth, each reflecting unique\
  \ density patterns and building forms. This clustering reveals how Singapore's planning\
  \ ideologies have transitioned from maximising space utilisation to prioritising\
  \ sustainability and quality of living. This signifies a paradigm shift towards\
  \ a comprehensive and inclusive urban design ethos. The paper contributes to the\
  \ urban planning discourse by underscoring the technological advancements, especially\
  \ with merging spatial data and GIS, in shaping modern urban analytics and planning.\
  \ The insights from the clustering analysis enhance our understanding of Singapore's\
  \ exceptional urban path and offer valuable perspectives for other metropolises\
  \ navigating the complexities of urban expansion and sustainability."
