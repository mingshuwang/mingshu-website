abstract: Land use conflicts (LUCs) are pivotal in understanding the complex interactions
  between human activities and global changes. This paper proposes a conceptual framework
  to analyze LUCs, focusing on land use suitability (LUS), scarcity, and diverse development
  objectives. It introduces a multi-level spatial assessment framework designed to
  identify LUCs, promoting sustainable land use practices. We chose China as the case
  study due to its status as the largest developing country and its intricate land
  use challenges. By integrating the \"ecological-agricultural-urban\" function with
  a four-tier classification of conflict intensity, our study identifies 12 distinct
  conflict patterns. Additionally, we classified LUCs into nine archetypes based on
  competing land use attributes within each 250-meter grid cell. Our empirical results
  show that the current LUS in China has intensified land use rivalry and conflicts.
  The geographical distribution, land category composition, and the intensity and
  manifestation of these conflicts exhibit significant variability across different
  LUC zones. We identified 14 regional zones, highlighting significant spatiotemporal
  variations in conflict distribution. Key findings include the positive impact of
  converting unused land to forestland and the negative effects of transforming agricultural
  land into construction land. These findings underscore the need for tailored land
  management strategies for each city or region, based on their specific development
  contexts.
