abstract: Since COVID-19 spread rapidly worldwide, many countries have experienced
  significant growth in the number of confirmed cases and deaths. Earlier studies
  have examined various factors that may contribute to the contagion rate of COVID-19,
  such as air pollution, smoking, humidity, and temperature. As there is a lack of
  studies at the neighborhood-level detailing the spatial settings of built environment
  attributes, this study explored the variations in the size of the COVID-19 confirmed
  case clusters across the urban district Huangzhou in the city of Huanggang. Clusters
  of infectious cases in the initial outbreak of COVID-19 were identified geographically
  through GIS methods. The hypothetic relationships between built environment attributes
  and clusters of COVID-19 cases have been investigated with the structural equation
  model. The results show the statistically significant direct and indirect influences
  of commercial vitality and transportation infrastructure on the number of confirmed
  cases in an infectious cluster. The clues ch inducing a high risk of contagions
  have been evidenced and provided for the decision-making practice responding to
  the initial stage of possible severe epidemics, indicating that the local public
  health authorities should implement sufficient measures and adopt effective interventions
  in the areas and places with a high probability of crowded residents.
