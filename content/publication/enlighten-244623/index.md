abstract: The prosperity of ride-sharing services has rippled in the communities of
  GIScience, transportation, and urban planning. Meanwhile, road network structure
  has been analyzed from a network science perspective that focuses on nodes and relational
  links and aims to predictive models. However, limited empirical studies have explored
  the relationship between road network structure and ride-sharing accessibility through
  such perspective. This paper utilizes the spatial Durbin model to understand the
  relationship between road network structure and ride-sharing accessibility, proxied
  by Uber accessibility, through classical network measures of degree, closeness,
  and betweenness centrality. Taking the city of Atlanta as a case study, we have
  found in addition to population density and road network density, larger values
  of degree centrality and smaller values of closeness centrality of the road network
  are associated with better accessibility of Uber services. However, the effects
  of betweenness centrality are not significant. Furthermore, we have revealed heterogeneous
  effects of degree centrality and closeness centrality on the accessibility of Uber
  services, as the magnitudes of their effects vary by different time windows (i.e.,
  weekday vs. weekend, rush hour in the morning vs. evening). Network science provides
  us both conceptual and methodological measures to understand the association between
  road network structure and ride-sharing accessibility. In this study, we constructed
  road network structure measures with OpenStreetMap, which is reproducible, replicable,
  and scalable because of its global coverage and public availability. The study resonates
  with the notion of cities as the set of interactions across networks, as we have
  observed time-sensitive heterogeneous effects of road network structure on ride-sharing
  accessibility.
