abstract: 'In urban transportation systems, taxis are regarded as flexible, convenient,
  and time-saving. Taxi demand is affected by various built-environment factors and
  by the time of the day. Although many studies have investigated correlations between
  taxi demand and the built environment, the direct and spillover effects of built
  environment factors on taxi demand have not been examined at a fine spatial scale.
  To address this gap in the literature, this paper employs spatial econometric models
  using GPS-tracked taxi trips, mobile signaling data, and points of interest (POIs)
  to study taxi demand in Beijing at a 1-kilometer square grid resolution. The results
  show that, in the morning and evening peak hours, road network density has the strongest
  (positive) direct and indirect impact on taxi ridership. A relationship is also
  found between public transportation and taxi ridership: bus coverage has positive
  direct effects and insignificant indirect effects on taxi pick-ups and drop-offs,
  while subway coverage has negative indirect effects, suggesting that it may absorb
  taxi demand from surrounding grids. Results also indicate that various built-environment
  factors affect taxi demand differently at morning and evening peak times. This study
  reveals the complex nature of taxi ridership and has important implications for
  policymakers, transport planners, and other stakeholders in megacities around the
  world.'
