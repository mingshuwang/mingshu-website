abstract: The conservation of historical heritage can bring social benefits to cities
  by promoting community economic development and societal creativity. In the early
  stages of historical heritage conservation, the focus was on the museum-style concept
  for individual structures. At present, heritage area vitality is often adopted as
  a general conservation method to increase the vibrancy of such areas. However, it
  remains unclear whether urban morphological elements suitable for urban areas can
  be applied to heritage areas. This study uses ridge regression and LightGBM with
  multi-source big geospatial data to explore whether urban morphological elements
  that affect the vitality of heritage and urban areas are consistent or have different
  spatial distributions and daily variations. From a sample of 12 Chinese cities,
  our analysis shows the following results. First, factors affecting urban vitality
  differ from those influencing heritage areas. Second, factors influencing urban
  and heritage areas' vitality have diurnal variations and differ across cities. The
  overarching contribution of this study is to propose a quantitative and replicable
  framework for heritage adaptation, combining urban morphology and vitality measures
  derived from big geospatial data. This study also extends the understanding of forms
  of heritage areas and provides theoretical support for heritage conservation, urban
  construction, and economic development.
