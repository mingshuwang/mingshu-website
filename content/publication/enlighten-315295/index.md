abstract: This study introduces a machine learning-based framework for mapping street
  patterns in urban morphology, offering an objective, scalable approach that transcends
  traditional methodologies. Focusing on six diverse cities, the research employed
  supervised machine learning to classify street networks into gridiron, organic,
  hybrid, and cul-de-sac patterns with the street-based local area (SLA) as the unit
  of analysis. Utilising quantitative street metrics and GIS, the study analysed the
  urban form through the random forest method, which reveals the predictive features
  of urban patterns and enables a deeper understanding of the spatial structures of
  cities. The findings showed distinctive spatial structures, such as ring formations
  and urban cores, indicating stages of urban development and socioeconomic narratives.
  It also showed that the unit of analysis has a major impact on the identification
  and study of street patterns. Concluding that machine learning is a critical tool
  in urban morphology, the research suggests that future studies should expand this
  framework to include more cities and urban elements. This would enhance the predictive
  modelling of urban growth and inform sustainable, human-centric urban planning.
  The implications of this study are significant for policymakers and urban planners
  seeking to harness data-driven insights for the development of cities.
