abstract: "In recent years, much research has been devoted to developing appropriate\
  \ analytical frameworks to capture polycentric urban development (PUD). In a recent\
  \ contribution to this journal, Bartosiewicz and Marciŉczak (2020) present what\
  \ is arguably the most comprehensive, comparative review to date of the degree to\
  \ which different analytical frameworks produce consistent results. The purpose\
  \ of this research note is to show why we believe parts of Bartosiewicz and Marciŉczak's\
  \ (2020) findings need nuance and qualification. Our starting point is that a useful\
  \ comparison between different studies and measurement frameworks needs to consider\
  \ the relevance of consistency in several key dimensions, two of which are particularly\
  \ pertinent here: (1) the careful specification of what constitutes a 'center' in\
  \ a polycentric urban system, and (2) the identification of the 'balance' between\
  \ centers as a measure of the degree of polycentricity. Two brief empirical analyses\
  \ of the degree of morphological polycentricity in Polish NUTS-3 areas and the Chinese\
  \ city-regions along the 'Yangtze Economic Belt' are included. Finally, suggestions\
  \ are provided to facilitate future comparative analyses of PUD."
