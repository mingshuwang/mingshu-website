abstract: The influence of neighbourhood characteristics on housing prices has gained
  increasing attention from scholars in recent decades. However, studies on the three-dimensional
  nature of urban space, and particularly the vertical dimension, have remained limited.
  This study investigates previously unexplored variables that can capture the vertical
  and horizontal dimensions of land-use configuration. In addition, this study proposes
  a spatially filtered multi-level approach to modelling variations in property values
  which can capture both spatial and multi-level effects. The research findings reveal
  a price premium for housing located in immediate neighbourhoods with more open mid-rise
  buildings and low plants. The results also demonstrate the varying effects of determinants
  of house pricing in spatially heterogeneous zones.
