abstract: The Sunda Banda Seascape (SBS), located in the center of the Coral Triangle,
  is a global center of marine biodiversity and a conservation priority. We proposed
  the first biophysical environmental delineation of the SBS using globally available
  satellite remote sensing and model-assimilated data to categorize this area into
  unique and meaningful biophysical classes. Specifically, the SBS was partitioned
  into eight biophysical classes characterized by similar sea surface temperature,
  chlorophyll a concentration, currents, and salinity patterns. Areas within each
  class were expected to have similar habitat types and ecosystem functions. Our work
  supplemented prevailing global marine management schemes by focusing in on a regional
  scale with finer spatial resolution. It also provided a baseline for academic research,
  ecological assessments and will facilitate marine spatial planning and conservation
  activities in the area. In addition, the framework and methods of delineating biophysical
  environments we presented can be expanded throughout the whole Coral Triangle to
  support research and conservation activities in this important region.
