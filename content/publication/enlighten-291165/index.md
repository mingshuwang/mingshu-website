abstract: Mass gatherings provide conditions for the transmission of infectious diseases
  and pose complex challenges to public health. Faced with the COVID-19 pandemic,
  governments and health experts called for suspension of gatherings in order to reduce
  social contact via which virus is transmitted. However, few studies have investigated
  the contribution of mass gatherings to COVID-19 transmission in local communities.
  In Hong Kong, the coincidence of the relaxation of group gathering restrictions
  with demonstrations against the National Security Law in mid-2020 raised concerns
  about the safety of mass gatherings under the pandemic. Therefore, this study examines
  the impacts of mass gatherings on the local transmission of COVID-19 and evaluates
  the importance of social distancing policies. With an aggregated dataset of epidemiological,
  city-level meteorological and socioeconomic data, a Synthetic Control Method (SCM)
  is used for constructing a 'synthetic Hong Kong' from over 200 Chinese cities. This
  counterfactual control unit is used to simulate COVID-19 infection patterns (i.e.,
  the number of total cases and daily new cases) in the absence of mass gatherings.
  Comparing the hypothetical trends and the actual ones, our results indicate that
  the infection rate observed in Hong Kong is substantially higher than that in the
  counterfactual control unit (2.63% vs. 0.07%). As estimated, mass gatherings increased
  the number of new infections by 62 cases (or 87.58% of total new cases) over the
  10-day period and by 737 cases (or 97.23%) over the 30-day period. These findings
  suggest the necessity of tightening social distancing policies, especially the prohibition
  on group gathering regulation (POGGR), to prevent and control COVID-19 outbreaks.
