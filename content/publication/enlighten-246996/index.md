abstract: Traffic congestion is an ever-increasing issue across urban environments
  in the US. One potential mitigation strategy is to improve our understanding of
  how the geographical patterns of urban land use influence congestion. Unfortunately,
  there is no consensus regarding if more sprawling or dense urban morphologies help
  mitigate congestion issues. To potentially clarify the conflicting findings of previous
  studies, we used a detailed spatial metric-based approach and panel regression to
  quantify the relationships between urban development patterns and congestion in
  98 US urban areas from 2001 to 2011. We found that the abundance and spatial configuration
  of urban land uses were correlated with traffic congestion. Specifically, high degrees
  of polycentricity for both high-intensity and low-intensity urban land uses were
  associated with more congestion, while contiguous residential development was correlated
  with less congestion. Important distinctions were also observed between different
  congestion measures, as urban morphology exhibited a more substantial influence
  on overall congestion than rush-hour congestion. Our findings can potentially inform
  future land use planning by clarifying which urban morphologies alleviate traffic
  congestion issues.
