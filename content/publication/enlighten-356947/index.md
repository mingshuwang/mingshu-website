abstract: Urban development is shaped by demographic and socio-economic factors, while
  simultaneously influencing these dynamics. Understanding these complex relationships
  is essential for informed urban planning, yet previous research has struggled with
  fine-scale analysis over large areas due to data and methodological limitations.
  This study overcomes these challenges by leveraging high-resolution building footprint
  data and eXplainable AI (XAI). Focusing on England between 2017 and 2023, we first
  quantify and map the extent of new urban development and further model it as a function
  of population density, ethnic composition, and the Index of Multiple Deprivation
  (IMD) using machine-learning algorithms. We then interpret the best-performing model
  with SHAP values and reveal a substantial nonlinear correlation between these demographic
  and socio-economic factors and new urban development. This analytical framework
  offers a novel, scalable, interpretable approach to fine-grained urban analysis,
  and, for the first time, provides a nationwide quantitative assessment of how population
  density, ethnic composition, and deprivation jointly shape urban development in
  England, thereby supporting evidence-based and equitable planning and policymaking.
