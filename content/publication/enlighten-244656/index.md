abstract: Due to the problem that current methods obtaining the weight values in intensive
  land use evaluation is influenced much by subjectivity of experts, cloud models
  to determine weight values were introduced in this study. Taking Guilin Advanced
  Technology Industry Development Zone as an example, cloud models was applied in
  intensive land use evaluation of development zone. Results showed that the comprehensive
  intensive land use value of Guilin Advanced Technology Industry Development Zone
  was 0.889, which achieved a sound balance between the supply and demand of land
  use. The state of land use reached a relatively high level of land use intensity
  as well as industrial land coverage. Based on land use efficiency, the output intensity
  of industrial land and high-tech land were both relatively high. In terms of management
  performance, there was no idle land, which suggested relatively perfect outcome
  of management. In the end, this paper summarized the advantages of using cloud models
  by presenting a more objective outcome and more easy-to-achieve algorithm. The application
  of Cloud Models is conducive to intensive land use evaluation in a more scientific
  way, so that it will benefit the policy-making processes of Guilin Advanced Technology
  Industry Development Zone.
