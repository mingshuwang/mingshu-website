abstract: Studies on polycentric urban development (PUD) have been done by using LandScan
  and point of interest data. So far, the quality of PUD products has been limited
  by the spatio-temporal resolution of these datasets. Using Sentinel-1 SAR missions
  with a 10 m pixel spacing and a weekly repeat cycle, this study, for the first time,
  explores the potential of using a time series of Sentinel-1 SAR images for measuring
  urban polycentricity. In particular, we develop a variance-based filtering method
  to mitigate speckle noise. We propose the Kittler and Illingworth with a Modified
  Model (KI-MM) method to accurately identify PUD-related changes. We focus on the
  mean distance of new-born patches and the mean patch area for a PUD-related change
  analysis. These allow us to associate SAR tailor-made output with PUDs. The proposed
  methods were implemented on Google Earth Engine platform using 304 Sentinel-1 SAR
  images on the city of Shanghai, China, acquired between 2015 and 2018. We have tested
  80 distribution models and found that the Laplace distribution is the best model
  for the KI-MM method. Our results show 2526, 2409, 4232 new-born patches for 2015-2016,
  2016-2017, 2017-2018, with areas equal to 18, 20, 36 km2, respectively. Using cross-validation
  with Sentinel-2 (optical) reference, we found that the matching rates and F1-score
  between detected changes and reference for the years 2015-2016, 2016-2017, 2017-2018
  were equal to 89.79% and 91.67%, 100% and 100%, 88.64% and 94.06%, respectively.
  We conclude that Sentinel-1 SAR images are suited to PUD applications at an intra-city
  scale with a high spatio-temporal resolution.
