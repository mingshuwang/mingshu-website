abstract: Despite much insightful work on polycentric urban development in China,
  there is a lack of systematic comparison at the intra-city level. Therefore, this
  paper explores polycentric urban development in 318 cities of China using detailed
  gridded population data. Our analysis examines the spatial structure of urbanized
  area within individual cities and identifies population centers within cities that
  are at the prefectural level and above. Our empirical results suggest that over
  90% of Chinese cities have four or fewer 'centers', and approximately 40% only have
  one 'dominating' center. Regression models reveal that higher degrees of polycentricity
  are associated with cities in fragmented landscapes. Conditioning on topographic
  characteristics and total land area, Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita is
  associated positively with high polycentricity in Eastern China. Furthermore, our
  analysis suggests that the development of multiple (sub)centers in a number of cities
  (e.g., Shanghai and Tianjin) is relatively consistent with their master plans.
