abstract: Urban parks are essential components of urban ecosystems, providing recreation
  and relaxation places to residents. Measuring the spatial accessibility to urban
  parks serves as an initial step in urban planning and developing urban development
  strategies to improve social and environmental justice. This study aims to evaluate
  measures of spatial accessibility to urban parks by comparing three geographic information
  systems (GIS)-based approaches, accounting for network complexity, transport modes,
  distance thresholds, and destination choices. Taking Ipswich City (Australia) and
  Enschede (the Netherlands) as two testbeds, we examine the spatial patterns of a
  total of 21 accessibility measures in the two cities and conduct a correlation and
  principal component analysis to unravel the interrelationship between these measures.
  The results suggest that among all measures under the three approaches, the selection
  of distance thresholds and transport modes matter more to accessibility measures
  than the destination choices. Furthermore, when distance threshold and transport
  mode are held constant, the network-based and entrance-based methods provide more
  realistic accessibility measures than other methods. We also discuss the generality
  of the entrance-based method we propose and suggest ways to choose the most appropriate
  accessibility measure for use in different contexts.
