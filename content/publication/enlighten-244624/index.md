abstract: "'Urban polycentricity' has become both a conceptual framework capturing\
  \ emerging empirical realities and a spatial planning vision adopted in cities across\
  \ Europe, USA, and, recently, also China. Despite the blossoming academic literature\
  \ on polycentricity, only limited attempts have been made to explore whether and\
  \ how polycentric urban development at different spatial scales affects the urban\
  \ economy. In this paper, we empirically analyse whether and how urban polycentricity\
  \ at different spatial scales in China is associated with urban economic performance.\
  \ To this end, we extend the Cobb-Douglas production function and include measures\
  \ of both inter-urban and intra-urban polycentricity to explain differences in labour\
  \ productivity. The analysis links intra-urban monocentricity and inter-urban polycentricity\
  \ with higher levels of labour productivity. In addition, the analysis points to\
  \ an agglomeration spillover effect, as well as a potential weak positive interaction\
  \ effect between intra- and inter-urban polycentricity. The paper concludes with\
  \ policy implications for China's spatial development."
