abstract: Universities are where innovations, face-to-face interactions and social
  capital are commonplace. Nevertheless, often regarded as 'the ivory tower', universities
  cannot be separated from the social and economic transformations outside of them.
  Traffic, information and financial flows between universities and other locations
  can be used to reveal connections between the ivory tower and other locales. Therefore,
  this paper uses the weekday public transit smartcard records from 6 to 9 April 2010
  (158,262 transit trips in total, including bus-only, bus plus subway and subway-only
  trips) to identify and profile the most popular destinations of student riders from
  the '985 universities' (a short list of top universities designated by the Chinese
  Central Government in 1999) and associated transit trip flows in Beijing. It identifies
  destination hotspots for the 985 universities' students in Beijing, allocates traffic
  volume to major roads and delineates the transit trips of students from each campus.
  The results indicate that there exist only weak ties and little movement between
  the top universities and the most disadvantaged areas.
