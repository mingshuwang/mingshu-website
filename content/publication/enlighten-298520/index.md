abstract: This research applies spatial Durbin model to analyse traffic flow distributions
  via various factors in the urban areas and traffic flow data. The results show that
  the overall built environment within a buffer area has more significant impact on
  urban traffic flow compared to the nearby location within a few meters. Areas with
  more young and white dwellers are associated with more traffic flows. With the influence
  of COVID-19, residents prefer to spend their daily life in their local neighborhood
  rather than having long distance travel. The initial findings from this research
  provide evidence of developing 20-minute city via active travel for achieving net-zero
  carbon target.
