abstract: The urban form is a foundational element in urban analytics, planning, and
  design. However, systematic and consistent depiction of urban form is challenging
  due to the complexity of urban elements and the variety of scales involved. This
  paper formalizes the concept of 'urban pattern language' as a multi-scalar analytical
  approach to decode such complexity, drawing on Christopher Alexander's idea that
  offers solutions for recurrent design problems observed in historic and contemporary
  urban settings. This analytic approach is applied to two case study cities to explore
  how urban forms can be decoded and communicated across scales and demonstrate how
  urban morphological elements can be systematically organised into recognisable patterns
  that simplify analysis and enhance understanding. The findings show that these patterns
  are not arbitrary but follow structured, rule-based relationships that vary across
  scales, revealing an underlying order within the urban form. Finally, the study
  illustrates that these rules are unique to each city, potentially reflecting specific
  cultural, historical, and spatial contexts. By identifying city-specific, multi-scalar
  patterns, this framework offers a powerful framework for urban planning and design,
  allowing practitioners to develop adaptable and context-sensitive strategies.
