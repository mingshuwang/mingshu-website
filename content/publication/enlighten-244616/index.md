abstract: The recent literature on the \"consumer city\" and the \"love of variety\"
  argues that the provision of urban amenities makes a city more attractive. Meanwhile,
  polycentric urban development has been highlighted by academics and policymakers
  as a sustainable urban development regime, although its purported benefits need
  to be further investigated. Against this background, this paper empirically examines
  the relationship between polycentricity and the provision of urban amenities in
  309 Chinese cities. After controlling for the size, population density, wage, and
  human capital, this paper finds that a higher degree of intra-urban polycentricity
  is associated with a larger number of urban amenities. Additionally, when all the
  covariates above are held, a higher degree of intra-urban polycentricity is associated
  with a greater diversity of urban amenities. Robust checks show that these findings
  are consistent with different polycentricity indices and diversity measures. Finally,
  possible explanations of the relationship between intra-urban polycentricity and
  urban amenities are provided from both the producer and consumer perspectives.
