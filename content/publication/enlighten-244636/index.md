abstract: 'In the past decades, there has been a resurgence of public bike-sharing
  systems (BSSs). While it is claimed that social and environmental benefits are associated
  with the implementation of BSSs, few empirical studies have investigated the actual
  congestion reduction effect of BSSs on cities. To fill such gap, this paper aims
  to examine whether the launch of BSSs can reduce citywide congestion. With a panel
  dataset of 96 urban areas in the US from 2005 to 2014, we employed a difference-in-differences
  model with two-way fixed-effects panel regression. The results suggested that the
  introduction of BSSs shows a significant mixed impact on congestion in general:
  Larger cities get better off but richer cities get worse off. Such results are consistent
  with both subsample regression with propensity score matching and different congestion
  measures. Post-hoc analysis reveals that BSSs have a significant positive effect
  on reducing rush-hour congestion. Finally, implications, limitations, and future
  work directions are offered.'
