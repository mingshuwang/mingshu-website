abstract: Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from fossil-fuel combustion are a global
  concern, and since 2007, China has become the nation with the highest amount of
  CO2 emissions. In order to understand China's carbon science research and reduction
  policies, it is crucial to benchmark CO2 emission estimates from different sources
  at multiple administrative levels. Therefore, this paper firstly compares the Emission
  Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGAR), the Fossil Fuel Data Assimilation
  System (FFDAS), and the China High Resolution Emission Gridded Data (CHRED) against
  energy census data from the National Bureau of Statistics of China (NBSC) at the
  province level. Results revealed that CHRED-today's finest resolution and most bottom-up
  approach of CO2 emission estimation in China-is the most consistent dataset with
  NBSC among the three (with both Pearson's R and Kendall's ensuremathτ of 0.86).
  Secondly, EDGAR and FFDAS are compared with CHRED at the prefectural level. Finally,
  empirical models were developed to reconcile EDGAR and FFDAS with CHRED at both
  province and prefectural levels to facilitate future longitudinal studies of CO2
  emissions in China.
