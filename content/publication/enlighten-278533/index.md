abstract: Urban functional regions (UFRs) are formed and developed with human social
  actions and can reflect urban land use types. Appropriately identifying UFRs helps
  solve existing urban problems, optimize the spatial structure of cities, and provide
  a database for sustainable urban development. Most existing studies focus on developing
  novel methods and fusing multiple data sources, but neglect the impact of heterogeneous
  spatial units on UFR identification results. In this work, a hierarchical spatial
  unit partition approach was proposed to split the research area into many hierarchical
  units whilst considering the mixed degree of each unit. We further explored its
  capacity for identifying UFRs by integrating it with three widely used UFR identification
  methods. The results reveal that our proposed approach can correctly identify 10%
  more UFRs compared with the traditional grid-based method, showing the efficiency
  of our proposed approach for identifying UFRs at a finer scale. This work provides
  support for those who are engaged in urban planning and urban policymaking, promoting
  urban sustainable development.
