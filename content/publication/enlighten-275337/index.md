abstract: Scholarly interest in the accessibility of ridesharing services stems from
  debates within the transportation and planning communities on the inequality of
  access to transit and the growing digital divide embedded within novel forms of
  transit services. Contributing to such discussions, this paper considers the city
  of Atlanta as a case study and explores the links between the spatial disparity
  of accessibility to different Uber ridesharing products and features of the built
  environment extracted from Google Street View (GSV) imagery. The variability of
  wait time for an Uber service is used as a proxy of accessibility, while semantic
  image segmentation is performed on GSV imagery using a deep learning model DeepLabv3+
  to identify notable spatial features captured at the eye-level perspective around
  service pick-up points. Results from spatial models show that proportions of built
  environment features such as buildings, vegetation, and terrains are associated
  with longer waiting times. In contrast, larger salient regions with foreground features
  are associated with shorter waiting times for several Uber service products.
