abstract: "As urban tourism becomes an indispensable part of urban dynamics, tourist\
  \ attractions are increasingly woven into residents' everyday living spaces. However,\
  \ the spatial patterns of, and level of mix between tourist and local attractions\
  \ have remained largely unknown. Taking advantage of the recent development in volunteered\
  \ geographic information, we used Flickr data to examine how tourists and locals'\
  \ destinations overlap spatially. We combined a density-based spatial clustering\
  \ algorithm, a dissimilarity index, spatial scan statistics, and location-based\
  \ tag clouds to explore the potential spatial and social interactions between tourists\
  \ and local residents in ten US cities: Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Houston, Los Angeles,\
  \ New York City, Orlando, San Francisco, Seattle, and Washington, D.C.. At the city-level,\
  \ we report the spatial distributions of visitors' and locals' destinations and\
  \ compare the overall level of segregation between the two groups. Within each city,\
  \ we identify the hotspots for visitors and locals and investigate the semantic\
  \ content for reasons behind visiting specific places. Finally, we discuss our findings\
  \ and provide implications for urban planning and tourism research."
