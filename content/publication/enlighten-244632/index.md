abstract: Inequality of accessibility in transportation systems is a constant concern,
  which is intensified by the transportation economization process and the digital
  divide. How should the accessibility of crowdsourced transportation is measured
  and understood? Without any prior assumption, this paper openly explores spatial
  disparities of accessibility in the city of Atlanta, USA using both the UberX (the
  most popular Uber product) and the UberBLACK (the premium Uber product) data. Accessibility
  is measured by both the expectation and variability of Uber wait time. With spatial
  autoregressive models, we find that after controlling for other socioeconomic factors,
  wealth and race do not have significant associations with Uber accessibility. Additionally,
  higher road network density, population density, and less commuting time to work
  correlate with greater Uber accessibility. More public transport stops are related
  to better accessibility of UberX but worse accessibility of UberBLACK. Finally,
  implications for policy-makers are provided.
