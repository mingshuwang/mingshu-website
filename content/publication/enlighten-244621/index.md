abstract: This article uses big data from images captured by Google Street View (GSV)
  to analyse the extent to which the built environment impacts the survival rate of
  neighbourhood-based social organisations in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. These organisations
  are important building blocks for social life in urban neighbourhoods. Examining
  these organisations' relationships with their environment has been a useful way
  to study their vitality. To extract data on built environment features from GSV
  images, we applied a deep learning model, DeepLabv3+. We then used elastic net regression
  to test the relationship between the built environment empirically - distinguishing
  between car-related, walking-related and mixed-use land infrastructure - and the
  survival of neighbourhood organisations. This testing approach is novel, to our
  knowledge not yet having been applied in Urban Studies. Besides revealing the effects
  of built environment features on the social life between buildings, our study points
  to the value of easily applicable observational big data. Data captured by GSV and
  other recently developed methods offer researchers the opportunity to conduct detailed
  yet relatively swift and inexpensive studies without resorting to overly coarse
  or common subjective measurements.
