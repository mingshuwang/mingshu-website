abstract: "The European Union (EU) Commission's whitepaper on Artificial Intelligence\
  \ (AI) proposes shaping the emerging AI market so that it better reflects common\
  \ European values. It is a master plan that builds upon the EU AI High-Level Expert\
  \ Group guidelines. This article reviews the masterplan, from a culture cycle perspective,\
  \ to reflect on its potential clashes with current societal, technical, and methodological\
  \ constraints. We identify two main obstacles in the implementation of this plan:\
  \ (i) the lack of a coherent EU vision to drive future decision-making processes\
  \ at state and local levels and (ii) the lack of methods to support a sustainable\
  \ diffusion of AI in our society. The lack of a coherent vision stems from not considering\
  \ societal differences across the EU member states. We suggest that these differences\
  \ may lead to a fractured market and an AI crisis in which different members of\
  \ the EU will adopt nation-centric strategies to exploit AI, thus preventing the\
  \ development of a frictionless market as envisaged by the EU. Moreover, the Commission\
  \ aims at changing the AI development culture proposing a human-centred and safety-first\
  \ perspective that is not supported by methodological advancements, thus taking\
  \ the risks of unforeseen social and societal impacts of AI. We discuss potential\
  \ societal, technical, and methodological gaps that should be filled to avoid the\
  \ risks of developing AI systems at the expense of society. Our analysis results\
  \ in the recommendation that the EU regulators and policymakers consider how to\
  \ complement the EC programme with rules and compensatory mechanisms to avoid market\
  \ fragmentation due to local and global ambitions. Moreover, regulators should go\
  \ beyond the human-centred approach establishing a research agenda seeking answers\
  \ to the technical and methodological open questions regarding the development and\
  \ assessment of human-AI co-action aiming for a sustainable AI diffusion in the\
  \ society."
