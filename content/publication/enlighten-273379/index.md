abstract: Urban traffic analysis has acted an important role in the process of urban
  development, which can provide insights for urban planning, traffic management and
  resource allocation. Meanwhile, the advancement of Intelligent Transportation Systems
  has produced a variety of traffic-related data from sensors and cameras to monitor
  urban traffic conditions in high spatio-temporal resolution. This research applies
  spatial regression models combined with computer vision and deep learning to analyse
  traffic flow distributions via various factors in the urban areas and traffic flow
  data. We include road characteristics and surrounding environments such as land
  use/cover, nearby points of interest (POI) and Google Street View images. The results
  show that the daily average traffic flow on main roads is much higher than smaller
  roads, and nearby POIs numbers have positive effect on traffic flows. The impact
  of land cover type is insignificant in the linear regression model, while demonstrates
  significant contribution to traffic flows in spatial regression models. Although
  the spatial autocorrelation still exists after the spatial regression, the spatial
  error model generates a better fit on the dataset. Further analysis will focus on
  extend the current model with the time parameters and understand what influence
  the changes of traffic flow in the different spatio-temporal scales.
