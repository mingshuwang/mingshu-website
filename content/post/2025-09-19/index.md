I am honored to be included once again in the Elsevier and Stanford University Top 2% Scientists list, marking my fourth consecutive year of recognition (2022–2025). In the 2025 edition, I ranked 581st worldwide and 32nd in the UK within Geological & Geomatics Engineering.

This recognition reflects the ongoing impact of my research in geospatial data science, GeoAI, and urban analytics — and I am grateful to my collaborators, students, and colleagues who make this journey possible.
