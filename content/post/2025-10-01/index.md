HKU and the University of Glasgow are strategic partners with a strong record of collaboration in research and education. This visit builds upon connections established through the Early Career Mobility Scheme ([ECMS](https://www.gla.ac.uk/explore/internationalisation/funding/earlycareermobilityscheme/))
, which Dr. Mingshu Wang undertook in 2022 to visit HKUâ€™s Department of Urban Planning and Design.

During his stay in Glasgow, Cuong will work closely with Dr. Wang on projects related to geospatial data science and urban vitality, further strengthening the partnership between HKU and UofG in advancing interdisciplinary research on cities and technologies.
