I’m pleased to share that I have been selected for the inaugural [UK GEO100](https://www.geo100.com/geo100_2025), a new national list recognising the 100 people who are shaping the future of geospatial science across the UK. The list spans four categories—Technical, Innovation, Research, and Commercial—and I’m honoured to be included in the Research category.

This recognition arrives at a moment when geospatial science is evolving faster than ever. My work in GeoAI, spatial big data analytics, and urban systems modelling has always aimed to push the discipline beyond incremental advances and to rethink how we build geospatial intelligence, how we integrate AI responsibly, and how we translate complex spatial data into decisions that matter.

Being part of the first GEO100 cohort is both an honour and a challenge I’m eager to meet. It strengthens my commitment to driving the next generation of geospatial research: more open, more explainable, more AI-enabled, and more connected to the urgent societal questions facing our cities and environments.

I’m grateful for the collaborators, students, and partners who have contributed to this journey. And I’m excited for what comes next—new ideas, new projects, and new opportunities to help shape the future of geospatial science in the UK and beyond.
