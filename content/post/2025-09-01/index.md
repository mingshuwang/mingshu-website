Together with Prof. Floris Vermeulen and Dr. Laura Dupin, I co-hosted a paper workshop for our forthcoming Special Issue in Urban Studies Journal (https://journals.sagepub.com/home/usj) on “Organizations and Urban Inequality”, held at the Institute for Advanced Study, University of Amsterdam (https://ias.uva.nl/content/events/2025/08/organizations-and-urban-inequality.html). 

Over two days, fifteen papers were presented, spanning urban sociology, organization theory, and urban economics. The workshop fostered interdisciplinary dialogue on how the spatial distribution of institutions, businesses, and community resources shapes patterns of social (in)equality, with contributions covering diverse contexts including Denmark, Nigeria, Italy, the US, China, and the Netherlands.
