PhD students Xinyi Yuan and Rui Deng from Dr. Mingshu Wang’s research group recently completed a research visit to Florida State University (FSU), hosted by Dr. Ziqi Li at the [Department of Geography](https://cosspp.fsu.edu/geography/faculty/ziqi-li/). Both students are co-supervised by Dr. Wang and Dr. Li.

During their visit, they took part in a Research Exchange Workshop organised by Dr. Li, where they presented their latest work to faculty and graduate students at [FSU’s Spatial Data Science Center](https://cosspp.fsu.edu/sdsc/).

[Xinyi Yuan](https://mingshuwang.org/author/xinyi-yuan/) presented her ongoing dissertation research using England’s building-footprint data. Some of her related publications can be found here: https://mingshuwang.org/publication/enlighten-356947/; https://mingshuwang.org/publication/enlighten-332243/.

[Rui Deng](https://mingshuwang.org/author/rui-deng/) delivered a talk on his recent advances with GeoAggregator, a new model for [scalable geospatial data analysis](https://mingshuwang.org/publication/enlighten-354147/), demonstrating its potential applications in urban and regional research.

This visit further strengthened the partnership between the two research groups and laid a solid foundation for continued collaboration, including joint publications, reciprocal research visits, and future PhD exchanges.
