I began my PhD studies in 2022 at the Amsterdam Institute for Social Science Research, University of Amsterdam. Prior to this, I earned a Master’s degree in Landscape Architecture from South China University of Technology and a Bachelor’s degree in Agriculture (Landscape Architecture) from Nanjing Forestry University. I also have two years of experience as an assistant designer in an architecture firm, working on commercial street design, resort design, and cultural tourism planning.

My current research focuses on exploring neighborhood users’ agency and autonomy in navigating the built environment, neighborhood networks, and public discussions. Mixed methods are adopted, including participant observation, interviews, questionnaires, big data, and more.
