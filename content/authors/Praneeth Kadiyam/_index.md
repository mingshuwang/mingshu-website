I hold a Master's degree in Geoinformatics from ITC, University of Twente in the Netherlands, and a Bachelor's degree in the same field from Andhra University, India. My academic background has provided a strong foundation in spatial data science, remote sensing, and geospatial technologies.

Currently, I work as an Innovation Engineer at Fugro, where I design and implement automation solutions for machine learning and geospatial workflows. My work spans domains such as Environmental Monitoring, Metocean, Climate and Nature, and Geotechnical Engineering. I also explore the integration of Edge computing and IoT to enhance data acquisition, processing, and decision-making in real-time applications.
