Before commencing my PhD, I obtained Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees in telecommunications and spent over six years working in France as a telecom engineer on national transmission networks. This experience deepened my curiosity about how large-scale network data reflect societal dynamics and reveal latent spatial or behavioural patterns relevant to urban applications.

My current research explores the intersection of geospatial AI, data ethics, and urban analytics, with an emphasis on positioning, navigation, and fairness in spatial data. I am particularly interested in understanding how AI systems embed and reproduce geographic biases and how such biases affect the accessibility, quality, and equity of geospatial information.
