Nana Lin is a Ph.D. Candidate in Human Geography at Nanjing University, China. Her research centers on housing justice and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), specifically investigating the relationship between housing tenure disparities (e.g., ownership, renting, informal settlements) and human well-being. She examines how these differences in housing access and security impact residents' daily lives, health, social inclusion, and overall well-being at the micro-level. Her research has been supported by the Jiangsu Provincial Postgraduate Research & Practice Innovation Program and the Nanjing University International Exchange Scholarship.
