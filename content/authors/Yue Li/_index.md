Yue Li is currently a Ph.D. candidate in Urban Studies at the University of Glasgow, based at the Urban Big Data Centre (UBDC) within the School of Social and Political Sciences. She began her doctoral research in 2021, focusing on urban mobility, spatial data science, and time-series analysis. Prior to joining the University of Glasgow, she obtained an M.Sc. in Spatio-Temporal Analytics and Big Data Mining from University College London in 2019 and a B.Sc. in Environmental Science from Beijing Normal University in 2018.

Yue's research focuses on applying machine learning, deep learning, and large language models to analyse and forecast traffic flow distributions under both normal and disruptive conditions. She integrates a range of emerging urban big data sources, including built environment features, socio-economic indicators, and Google Street View imagery. As part of her work, Yue has also developed a long-term, high-resolution traffic flow dataset at an intra-city scale, capturing fine-grained spatio-temporal dynamics.
