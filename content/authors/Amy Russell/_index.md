Following my MSc in Geoinformation Technology & Cartography at The University of Glasgow, I co-published a paper with Mingshu Wang and Ziqi Li - Equalizing urban agriculture access in Glasgow: A spatial optimization approach. I worked in an environmental consultancy, creating both static and interactive maps for various ecology, land management and planning projects. In addition I worked on GIS projects for companies such as utility companies and councils, which involved data collation, processing and analysis. I now work as a Data and Geospatial Analyst for The University of Edinburgh on The Forest and Peatland Programme. This is a reforestation and peatland restoration project as part of the universityâ€™s commitment to be net zero by 2040, led by the Department for Social Responsibility and Sustainability. In this role I initially assisted with mapping site constraints and preparing plans for woodland creation schemes. Going forward there is more of a focus on assisting with the collation of research data from the sites, creating interactive mapping platforms to illustrate what is happening on site, and creating field data collection tools for monitoring the health of the woodlands.
